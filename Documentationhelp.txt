Yes, this is indeed a machine learning project. Based on the code you've shared, I can help you identify the key components and algorithms used for the documentation. Here's a breakdown:

Machine Learning Algorithm:

The primary algorithm used is Random Forest Classifier.
This can be seen in the Train_model.py file:
python

Edit
Copy code
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
Data Collection:

Custom dataset created using webcam captures of hand gestures.
Each gesture corresponds to a letter of the English alphabet (A-Z).
Data collection process is implemented in Data_Collection.py.
Data Preprocessing:
data set from kaggel is used to train indian hand gesture

Hand landmark detection using MediaPipe.
Feature extraction from hand landmarks.
Normalization of coordinates.
Implemented in Data_Preprocessing.py.
Model Training:

Splitting data into training and testing sets.
Training the Random Forest Classifier on preprocessed data.
Evaluation using accuracy score.
Implemented in Train_model.py.
Real-time Prediction:

Uses OpenCV for webcam feed processing.
MediaPipe for real-time hand landmark detection.
Applies the trained model for prediction.
Implemented in Predictor_GUI.py.
User Interface:

GUI built using Tkinter and customtkinter.
Real-time video feed display.
Prediction display and word/sentence formation.
Text-to-speech functionality using pyttsx3.
